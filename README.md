# Family-Tree
**Family Tree** is a React-based web app that visualizes my large, multi-generational family structure through an interactive graph. 

This project was built to map out my own extended family, and currently includes **244 members**. Itâ€™s still a work in progress, but the goal is to eventually map out both sides of my family and preserve these stories.

## Features
- Interactive graph visualization of family relationships
- Click on any family member to learn more about them   
- Automatically builds the tree from a structured JSON file  
- Scalable for families with hundreds of members  
- Built in **React** with for easy browsing
